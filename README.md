# minicoord
minicoord is a Python service that manages a pool of render machines.  This code is a simplified Python
implementation of the full (Java) Arras Coordinator service used at DWA.  It is less robust than the
full version, and lacks some of the more advanced machine allocation features, but should be sufficient
to demonstrate Arras multi-machine execution of Moonray.

This repository is part of the larger MoonRay/Arras codebase.  It is included as a submodule in the top-level
OpenMoonRay repository located here: [OpenMoonRay](https://github.com/dreamworksanimation/openmoonray)
